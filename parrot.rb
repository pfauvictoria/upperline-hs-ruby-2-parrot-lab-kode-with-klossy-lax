# Happy Parrot - This parrot is so happy. It accepts a 'thing' as its argument and then returns a string where it says how happy it is about the thing!
def happy_parrot(thing)
  "I am so happy about #{thing}!"
end

# Boring Parrot - Write a method for a boring parrot that just returns whatever string you give him as an argument.
def boring_parrot(thing2)
  "#{thing2}"
end
# Math Parrot - Create a method that accepts two numbers as arguments and adds them together!
def math_parrot(x, y)
  x + y
end

# Friendly Parrot - This parrot greets people by returning their name and age (don't forget to pass that information in as arguments).
def friendly_parrot(name, age)
  "Hi #{name}. You are #{age} years old! Nice to meet you."
end
# Favorites Parrot - Tell this parrot about your three favorite things and he will return "I love <that thing> too!" for each of them.
def favorites_parrot(thing1, thing2, thing3)
  "I love #{thing1} too! I love #{thing2} too! I love #{thing3} too!"
end


# Now try calling your methods below with any arguments of your choice and puts them to the screen. Like this:
puts happy_parrot("waffles")
puts boring_parrot("I am boring!".upcase)
puts math_parrot(4, 5)
puts friendly_parrot("Torie", 17)
puts favorites_parrot("socks", "glasses", "LA")
# call your methods here


# Now let's pretend you are a wizard and you want to place a spell on each of the parrots so that they speak backwards. How would you do that?




# The spell has been broken and everyone is speaking normally again. The parrots are really excited about it though - make them shout in all caps.
